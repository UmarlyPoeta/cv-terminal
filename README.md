# 👨‍💻 Terminal Portfolio – Patryk Kozłowski

A retro-style personal portfolio built to look and feel like a black & green terminal from the 80s. Commands like `about`, `projects`, `skills`, and `contact` simulate a real CLI experience.

## 💡 Commands

- `about` – a short bio and current goals
- `projects` – list of selected GitHub repositories with ASCII art
- `education` – your academic background
- `skills` – tech stack, tools, and relevant knowledge
- `hobbies` – what I tinker with outside of coding
- `contact` – how to reach me
- `cls` – clear the screen
- `help` – see the list of commands

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- ASCII art
- Terminal-style animation with simulated typing
- Mobile responsive layout

## 📱 Mobile Friendly

The terminal interface is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
